## Setup

You will need to install PyBullet to run the simulation. 

```shell
pip3 install pybullet

```

Here is the [PyBullet tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10sXEhzFRSnvFcl3XxNGhnD4N2SedqwdAvK3dsihxVUA/edit#heading=h.2ye70wns7io3).

## Info

This is the Github repo for a bipedal robot that I am developing featuring my custom made QDD actuator, SpryDrive. Compare the "chickenwalker" design to Agility Robotics' Cassie, as well as the Blackbird bipedal robot. The focus of my design is to move the CoM as far upward as possible (to better match the SLIP model) while also reducing limb inertia and optimizing for low weight, profile, and simplicity. I am currently learning to use methods such as whole body operational space control for the balancing controller.
